# SCXcodeMinimap v2.0
SCXcodeMiniMap is a Xcode plugin that adds a source editor Minimap to Xcode.

Version 2.0 has been rewritten from the ground up to address performance issues (delays on large source files - 1000+ lines) and for creating a better base to build upon. As such, the following new features are now supported:

#### New Features
- Faster syntax highlighting
- Shows code foldings
- Comment and preprocessor directive highlighting
- Breakpoint highlighting
- All highlighting options are also available for the main Xcode editor
- Custom themes
- All options are accessible from the View/Minimap menu item
